About
====
XPod is a replacement for the sluggish and overkill [cocoapods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) that is either praised or hated.

It's written in objective-c so it's very fast.

Right now it's still in very early stage.

Dependencies
====
- [libyaml](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml) for ... well you guessed
